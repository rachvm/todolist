Plan

1. Before starting to plan research creating a full stack project with react
    1. Revisit past projects to refamiliarise myself with backend and front end processes
    2. Watch videos on creating full stack applicatons to develop my understanding on how these work, particularly how the backend node.js interacts with react.js. At no point will I copy any code because it is important that I learn how to build my own application from scratch so I fully understand the processes. websites I used:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8 - takes ypu through backend, frontend, bthen fullstack
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcRFYF4B3IQ - talks about post request and how to make a loading button
